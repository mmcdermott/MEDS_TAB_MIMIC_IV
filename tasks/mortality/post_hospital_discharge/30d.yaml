description: >- This file specifies the base configuration for the prediction of mortality within 30 days of
  hospital discharge. This task features no gap window, nor does it feature any censoring protection --- e.g.,
  patients for whom there is not data for a full 30 days post discharge _will be presumed to survive._
  Note that this task is post-**hospital discharge** mortality, not post-**ICU discharge** mortality or in-*
  mortality or next-30d mortality, all of which are different tasks.
